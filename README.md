# Event-Management-App
Web app in React-JS and database connectivity with Express and Mongoose

This an event management Web App.Here user can create an event and register for others according to the specific roles.

Just a suggestion before using the app.Here are some key points need to be remembered
1. There are two seperate folders for frontend and backend so open seperate terminals for them 
2. Use npm start for the both the folders "projfrontend","projfrontend"
3. App might initially run slow so be patient.
